# Graph neural networks for community detection (GNN4CD)
Graph Neural Networks and Line Graph Neural Networks for community detection, as described in the paper **_Supervised community detection with graph neural networks_** by Zhengdao Chen, Joan Bruna and Lisha Li, to appear in ICLR 2019 (https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1g0Z3A9Fm). The implementation is in Python with Pytorch, and partially adapted from https://github.com/alexnowakvila/QAP_pt.

Running _script_5SBM_gnn.sh_ and _script_5SBM_lgnn.sh_ will perform the experiments of community detection for 5-class dissortive stochastic block models using a graph neural network (GNN) and a line graph neural network (LGNN), respectively.
